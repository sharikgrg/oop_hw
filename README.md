# OOP
- This repo contains examples of OOP from my initial OOP classes
- There is a class with attributes and methods
- The class has been tested in a separate .py file to create objects and use methods

## Definitions

- Object oriented Programming:  refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure.

- Abstraction: The process of picking out (abstracting) common features of objects and procedures.
- Polymorphism: A programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.
- Encapsulation: The process of combining elements to create a new entity. A procedure is a type of encapsulation because it combines a series of computer instructions.
- Inheritance: a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different classes. .super()

- Class: A category of objects. The class defines all the common properties of the different objects that belong to it.

- Object: a self-contained entity that consists of both data and procedures to manipulate the data.

- attributes: 
- methods: Can only call it when it is attached to a object
